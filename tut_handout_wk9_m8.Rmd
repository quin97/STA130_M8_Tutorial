*I will post the following material on Quercus in advance for students to access*

Prior to starting the activity, you must review the videos on [Plagiarism](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/pages/m8-problem-set-plagiarism-video?module_item_id=3512102) and [Hedging](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/pages/m8-problem-set-hedging-video?module_item_id=3512103). These videos goes over the 6 most common types of plagiarism and how to avoid them. 

Once you have watched the video, please read the following article: Ross *et al.* (2022) "Women are Credited Less in Science than are Men". This article is available in Module 8  on quercus (link: [https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/pages/m8-problem-set-8-paper?module_item_id=3512104](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/pages/m8-problem-set-8-paper?module_item_id=3512104) ) and the paper online [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04966-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04966-w). (If you don't yet know how to get access to a journal article through UT library, it's a good time to ask for help from your TA or your peers.)

Once you have watched the videos and read the artcile, you will prepare a 10-min group presentation providing a summary of the above study. Make sure you explain the following, at a minimum:  

- Objective: What are the authors interested in studying? Why is it important to conduct this study?

- Methods: What type of study design is used? Who are the participants? What statistical tests are used?

- Results: What are the main findings of the study? Make sure you support any statements with facts (e.g. proportions, p-values, etc.), and present the results in the context of the study. 

- Conclusions: What are the most important take away messages to you? Are there any important limitations or future directions?
